## DESCRIPTION

### LEARNING GOALS

- Practice using structs
- Read items from file into structure
- Write a linear search algorithm

### BACKGROUND

Imagine youâ€™re at the beach and want to order a number of items from the snack bar. You have a limited amount of cash on you, and you want to get a total cost for your items before ordering.

### Implementation Details

Read in the menu items from the `snack_bar.txt` to the `menu` structure. Print out the menu items and their prices, prompting you to keep selecting items until you press enter without typing anything in. Write `get_cost` finction to returns the cost of each item, and `add_items` function to add the chosen menu items. When you are creating a linear search algorithm in `get_cost`, do make sure that it is case insentive.
